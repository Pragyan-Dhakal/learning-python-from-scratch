"""Here are the different **types of tuples**:

1. **Empty Tuple**:
   - A tuple with no elements.
   - Syntax: `empty_tuple = ()`

2. **Single-element Tuple**:
   - A tuple with only one element. A comma is necessary to indicate that it is a tuple.
   - Syntax: `single_element_tuple = (element,)`

3. **Multi-element Tuple**:
   - A tuple with two or more elements.
   - Syntax: `multi_element_tuple = (element1, element2, element3, ...)`

4. **Nested Tuple**:
   - A tuple containing other tuples as elements.
   - Syntax: `nested_tuple = ((element1, element2), (element3, element4))`

5. **Heterogeneous Tuple**:
   - A tuple with elements of different data types.
   - Syntax: `heterogeneous_tuple = (1, 'string', True, 3.14)`

6. **Tuple of Lists**:
   - A tuple where elements are lists.
   - Syntax: `tuple_of_lists = ([1, 2], [3, 4])`

7. **Tuple of Tuples**:
   - A tuple where elements are also tuples.
   - Syntax: `tuple_of_tuples = ((1, 2), (3, 4))`

These are the most common types of tuples used in Python."""
